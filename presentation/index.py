# Pso Implementation

## Introduction
The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm that was inspired by the social behavior of birds. The algorithm is initialized with a population of random solutions and searches for optima by updating generations. The solutions are updated by following two influences: the personal best solution found by each particle and the global best solution found by the entire swarm. The algorithm is terminated when a maximum number of generations is reached, or an acceptable fitness level is achieved for the population.
